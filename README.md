# BBiGLaM-Godot
A remake of my old Baldi game in Godot. This is strictly a mobile game.

### About
-------------
I made this project originally a few months before but in C#. Unbeknownst to me at the time, Godot 4 Mono doesn't support building for Android yet which means I was stuck with this project unless I port it to GDScript. So that's what I did. <br>
Being a total rewrite, I still kept the original code placement and that is why Game.gd is still very cramped. Maybe I should have just used different scripts for enemies and stuff, whatever. With Godot's editor this isn't too much of a pain to manage. <br>
It feels really nice to see this game finally working and fully complete, as even the C# version wasn't 100% finished when I stopped development on it. The game has only been tested on Android as I don't have access to Apple's devices and as such, they are unsupported.

### Getting Started
-------------
To compile this project, you will need at least Godot v4.1. Do not forget you will need the required export templates. <br> 
More in-depth guide is avaiable here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html <br>
You're free to modify the project as you wish.

### Credits
-------------
I will only list some credits here, as the full list is in the game itself, in the Credits menu. <br>
Thanks to DipShtick (Varga) testing. <br>
Graphical and musical assets were made by Basically, Games! (Baldi's Basics Plus) <br>
UI was made by MadFireOn (Hyper Casual UI) <br>
